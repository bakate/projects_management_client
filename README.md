# Projects Management

This is a simple project management system that allows you to create, read, update and delete projects. Each project has a name, description, status (active, suspended and completed ) and a list of tasks. Each task has a title and a status ( in progress, completed).
 It is built using React + TypeScript + Vite


## How to run the project
- Clone the project
```bash
 docker-compose up --build
```
